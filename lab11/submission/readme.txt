To whom it may concern,

This is a little knock off of flappy bird. When controlling the bird, the only key to press is the space bar. If you go too far off the screen or if you collide with the white rectangles the game will end. The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible by flying through the slots in the rectangles. Also, please be aware that the strength of your connection to the virtual machine may induce some lag. 

Enjoy!
